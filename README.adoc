= ISO OBP data access in Ruby

== Background

The https://www.iso.org/obp/ui[ISO Online Browsing Platform (OBP)] is the ISO
official location to obtain informative content from ISO standards.

NOTE: Normative content of ISO standards is paywalled.

Informative content provided on the OBP include:

* Introduction (if present)
* Scope
* Normative references
* Terms and definitions
* Bibliography

== Use cases

There are many situations where the informative content is already useful:

* ISO project editors: obtain machine-readable content of informative clauses to
  start a revision without waiting for the complicated STS XML file.

* Terminology users: obtain term and definition details from a standard.

* Bibliography users: find out what documents this standard refers to.

== Usage

=== Fetching from ISO OBP

[source,sh]
----
bundle exec exe/obp-access -o output iso:std:iso:5598:ed-3:v1:en
----

=== Converting an ISO OBP HTML document into STS

WARNING: This is WORK IN PROGRESS.

[source,sh]
----
bundle exec exe/obp2sts output/index.html
# => output/index.html.xml # Preprocessed XML file using Nokogiri for easier processing (#clean method)
# => output/index.html.sts.xml # Full STS XML file (#to_sts method)
----
